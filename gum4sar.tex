\subsubsection{Measurand and measurement model}

The geophysical Doppler shift is the measurand, defined as \dots.

The geophysical Doppler frequency shift is calculated as
\begin{equation}
  \varpi_g = \varpi_{\rm dc} - \varpi_{\rm geo} - \varpi_{\rm e} + \Delta\varpi^*,
  \label{eq:DCcomponents}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\varpi_{\rm dc}$ is the Doppler centroid frequency shift,
$\varpi_{\rm geo}$ is a geometric term related to the antenna pointing via the
satellite's orbit and attitude, $\varpi_{\rm e}$ is an electronic term
resulting from antenna mis-pointing, and $\Delta\varpi^*$ is the residual error.
The estimate of each term comes with uncertainty as described in the following
sub-sections.

\subsubsection{Traceability Diagram}

\subsubsection{Uncertainty of the Doppler Centroid Frequency Shift}

The Doppler centroid frequency shift (DC) is usually estimated from the azimuth
power spectrum of the SAR beam. For ASAR data published at
\url{https://data.met.no/dataset/e19b9c36-a9dc-4e13-8827-c998b9045b54}, the
estimation algorithm is based on \cite{bamler91}, but extended to correct the
azimuth spectra for energy aliased from neighboring areas \cite{hansen26}. The
same model is used to calculate the standard deviation of the DC estimate,
which gives the standard uncertainty, $\sigma_{\rm dc}$, of $\varpi_{\rm dc}$.
Figure~\ref{fig:dc} shows $\sigma_{\rm dc}$ and $\varpi_{\rm dc}$ of an Envisat
ASAR acquisition over the Amazon rain forest on
2010-02-19T14:02:27.240842+00:00.

  \caption{Distributions of global Doppler centroid anomaly (DCA; VV
  polarization) measurements over land between the 27th January and 16th
  February 2012 following (a) subtraction of the Doppler shift resulting from a-priori
  orbit and attitude estimates given in auxiliary orbit and attitude data files
  from DC, and (b) after attitude correction by manual fit. Panel (c) shows the
  orbital variation of the residual geometric Doppler frequency shift,
  $\varpi^{\rm r}_1(\gamma_h)$ (dots), and the interpolated signal,
  $\varpi^{\rm r}_2(\gamma_h)$ (solid line), and panel (d) shows the DCA
  distribution attributed to electronic mis-pointing, $\varpi_e$, and random
  noise, $\Delta\varpi$, after also correcting for the orbital variation.}

Figure~\ref{fig:mispointing-corr} shows the DC measurements over land after
step-wise subtraction of (a) the Doppler shift resulting from a-priori orbit
and attitude estimates given in auxiliary orbit and attitude data files and (b)
after attitude correction obtained by manual fit.
Figure~\ref{fig:mispointing-corr}(c) shows the remaining residual as a function
of the satellite hour angle, i.e., its orbit, and
Figure~\ref{fig:mispointing-corr}(d) shows the DC measurements, or Doppler
Centroid Anomaly (DCA), after subtraction of the orbital bias. The uncertainty
of the corrections can be described by the variance around the mean DCA in bins
of the sensor view angle, as shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:antenna-pattern-with-errorbars} for the third sub-swath, where
the error bars represent the experimental standard deviation in each bin.

\noindent {\bf Uncertainty of the Antenna Pattern.} Equation E.3 from GUM?

$z=f(w_1, w_2, ..., w_N)$

$\displaystyle\sigma_z^2 = \sum_{i=1}^N (\frac{\partial f}{\partial w_i})^2\sigma_i^2 + 2\sum_{i=1}^{N-1}\sum_{j=i+1}^N \frac{\partial f}{\partial w_i}\frac{\partial f}{\partial w_j}\sigma_i\sigma_j\rho_{ij}$

What about the Mean vs the Shape?

\subsubsection{Uncertainty of the Geophysical Doppler Shift}

\begin{equation}
  \Delta\varpi^* = \Delta\varpi_{\rm lb} + \Delta\varpi,
  \label{eq:final-residual}
\end{equation}

{\bf By propagation of errors.}

{\bf By considering the variance over land.}

See Figure~\ref{fig:fg_plot}. The mean is here $-0.10$~Hz, with standard deviation $6.9$~Hz.
